## What is Process Lasso?

**Process Lasso** is an advanced and highly acclaimed PC optimization utility designed to enhance system responsiveness, stability, and overall performance. It achieves this through its intelligent **Process Priority Optimization** and **CPU Affinity Management** algorithms. Unlike basic task managers, Process Lasso proactively works in the background to ensure your system remains smooth, especially under heavy loads, by preventing poorly behaved processes from consuming excessive CPU resources and causing system stalls or freezes.

For gamers, streamers, and power users, Process Lasso is an indispensable tool that can lead to higher and more stable FPS, reduced input lag, and a noticeably more responsive system. It is compatible with a vast array of software and games, including demanding titles and professional applications. Its unique **ProBalance** (Process Balance) technology is the core feature that dynamically adjusts process priorities to maintain system interactivity without sacrificing the performance of foreground applications.
